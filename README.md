"# StaticLibrary" 


Hi, This is the instruction of StaticLibrary 


1. Commit .h and .cpp files , include .vcxproj and .vcxproj.filters are required.

2. the project must can be run successfully in Visual Studio 2017, then it can compile and built in Virtual Machine, like appveyor.  Since We need to upload the .vcxproj files, which is generated by Visual Studio 


TrouthShooting : 

1. C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V140\Microsoft.Cpp.Platform.targets(57,5): error MSB8020: The build tools for v141 (Platform Toolset = 'v141') cannot be found. To build using the v141 build tools, please install v141 build tools.  Alternatively, you may upgrade to the current Visual Studio tools by selecting the Project menu or right-click the solution, and then selecting "Retarget solution". [c:\projects\myproject\MathFuncsLib\MathFuncsLib.vcxproj]


Answer: .vcxproj file is not match  !  

2. Test: Compile the code again using VS 2015 in Appveyor, to see whether it is build successful  !  

It does not work ! The reason is that the current .vcxproj file is generated by Visual studio 2017 !  
 C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V140\Microsoft.Cpp.Platform.targets(57,5): error MSB8020: The build tools for v141 (Platform Toolset = 'v141') cannot be found. To build using the v141 build tools, please install v141 build tools.  Alternatively, you may upgrade to the current Visual Studio tools by selecting the Project menu or right-click the solution, and then selecting "Retarget solution".

 3. Test: I compile my code locally in Visual Studio 2017 , Debug, X86.  When I compile the code using appveyor, choose Debug, X64, it can successfully built. 
 So the platform do not matter !  


We already build the boost lib in local computer, we do need to link it to Visual studio in local. 

For appveyor, there is a built finished boost library, we need to use enviroment variables to connect it with Visual Studio both in appveyor.  


Attempt : 
4. swith X86 to X64 , then you know whether boost library is missing or not ! ! 


4. we must have sln file on appveyor

5. vcxproj files determines from  which files get compiled ! 




6. Most Important : 
   make sure the enviroment setting are same for both Visual Studio and appveyor : 


   For example :  

In appveyor : 
   environment:
  BOOST_ROOT: C:\Libraries\boost_1_64_0
  BOOST_LIBRARYDIR: C:\Libraries\boost_1_64_0\lib64-msvc-14.1


In Visual Studio : 


Project-> Properties-> C/C++ ->General -> Additional Include Directories : C:\Libraries\boost_1_64_0    

Project-> Properties->Linker -> Additional Library Dependencies :  C:\Libraries\boost_1_64_0\lib64-msvc-14.1
